function [ A ] = awfulGraph( n )
%returns the adjacency matrix of an awful graph of size n
% awful graph has degree d=n-1; we first have an complete graph K(n-1),
% then we add an extra vertex p, and connect it to an arbitrary vertex in the
% complete graph, and then add n-2 self loop to p and then add one self loop to every vertex  
%   param: n number of vertices, size of the graph
